A quine is a program that outputs it's source code, as it's output

Technically this isn't a quine as it outputs binary, that translates to ASCII that isn't actually the source code,
but rather encrypted, but once you decrypt it is the offical source code of the project. It just used built in python libraries,
I created it after building a Caesar Cipher in a python class, and once I understood how a Caesar Cipher worked I worked on
making the source code as it's input, it was surprisingly easy.
